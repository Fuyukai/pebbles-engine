## note to future me: don't worry about adding too many fonts. we can always cache these
## also, as long as load times are below about 60s most people won't care i think
fonts:
    ## Used for the default NVL mode text. Mandatory.
    default:
        path: "engine/fonts/Mx437_IBM_Model3x_Alt4.ttf"
        size: 32

    ## Used for the top text in NVL scenes. Mandatory only if you're using the NVL renderer.
    top-text:
        # classpath path to font
        path: "engine/fonts/Mx437_Wang_Pro_Mono.ttf"
        # size to generate, scaled appropriately by viewport
        size: 48
        # primary colour attribute on the Font object, defaults to "white"
        # fonts are generated as white and then tinted.
        default_colour: "orange"

    ## Used for the error screen. If not present, uses the default font.
    error:
        path: "engine/fonts/Mx437_Wang_Pro_Mono.ttf"
        size: 24
